Authors - Ilemobayo Lijoka and Andiswa Radebe

"printf" which stands for print formatted is a pre-defined function in the C library used to write formatted output to the cosole or stdout. it takes a variable number of arguments and this makes it a variadic function or we say, it is implemented a s a variadic function. in this project, we are creating our own _printf() function that replicates the standard printf() function in c library.
